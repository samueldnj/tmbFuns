# tmbFuns

A repository for my TMB function libraries. Part of my push to refactor my workflow to a more efficient state.

I hope these functions are useful beyond my own work. Feel free to suggest functions, or to fork and golf my code. Submit a pull request, I'd love to see this grow from community involvement.

## How to use

I'm still working this out. I'll let you know once I've succesfully integrated the first library into my own models.
